# 🧠 Jobs Automation Scraper (Java + Selenium + Apache POI)

This project automates the extraction of job postings from the **Expleo** and **Alten** career websites, and generates a structured **Excel file** containing the job information. It is built with **Java**, uses **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation, and **Apache POI** for Excel file creation.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this application is to **automate the repetitive task of searching and copying job offers**, especially for tech consultants and engineers applying through service companies like **Expleo** and **Alten**.

Instead of manually navigating through job portals and copying content to Excel, this app:
- Automates the search process using Selenium
- Extracts job details such as title, location, date, description, qualifications, and job links
- Generates a clean `.xlsx` Excel file for easy review, filtering, or processing
